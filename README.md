for some reason the collision logic caused the entire project to crash and it wouldn't fix at all so I had to make everything from scratch

However I wont remove this repository because I am not going to comment until the collision code all over again

feel free to help what the problem was if you find it out or reading the comments up until the collision code

the variable names have changed here and there so just be alert
